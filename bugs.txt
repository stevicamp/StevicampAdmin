1. In index.html <div id="app" class="content-bar">  goes over <button id="right-bar-toggler" value="right-bar" class="button-toggle-vertical-bar">.
box-sizing: border-box; added to the style fixed it, and another bug as well.

2. <button id="right-bar-toggler" value="right-bar" class="button-toggle-vertical-bar"> when minimized the arrow is out of the container, the contianer button is resizedd to be smaller.
Bug caused by browser extension find lite. Had container at the bottom of the HTML, and showed 1 or more pixels container, at right side of the page.
