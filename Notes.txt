1. Add swipe on mobile devics for the images

Simple vanilla JS example for horizontal swipe:

let touchstartX = 0
let touchendX = 0
    
function checkDirection() {
  if (touchendX < touchstartX) alert('swiped left!')
  if (touchendX > touchstartX) alert('swiped right!')
}

document.addEventListener('touchstart', e => {
  touchstartX = e.changedTouches[0].screenX
})

document.addEventListener('touchend', e => {
  touchendX = e.changedTouches[0].screenX
  checkDirection()
})
You can use pretty much the same logic for vertical swipe by replacing X with Y.

Транспорт на товар
.....................................

.......................
1. Maybe Search History

2. Radio button css for the clicked item icons in the menu
to finish the icon style

3. Add function on the app container 
scrool to top, scroll to bottom, scroll to middle.

4. Add tab index on all buttons for the views


5. consider else if in globals search

6. consider data = items --> avoid items just use data

7. consider seperate search for the modal to search only in the id keys
..................................
#1. Searching "se" in global search gives Toyota Verso - 20025 г. two tiemes. 
Two times the same obejct. In the microbus search is only one, but in the global is dublicated - it is working properly, one is car other is bus

..........................
FOR MODAL

1. When item is generated there is added onclick in the generated html
2. in the onclick there is a common function for all items
3. The function gets the whole path and changes the url to only the current path, so in case there is ?search= or any other (maybe the search will be added to the history)
4. The id is passed to the method from generated html item with onclick with the function
5. the id is used to find the current item from the db
6. the object is returned
7. if empty object alert no such item
8. the object is used to populate predefined html for caravans, cars etc.
9. the modal is opened
10. on modal close restore the url maybe push state or pop state should be used 




.....................

#1. Item links are not generated properly. itemType should be item.category

now it is - http://localhost:8080/index.html/Caravan-Knaus-fendt-Sunshine-540-D2025-01-21T17-59-45.662Z!idfgd87873fgfdg8q78


#1. To see if it is problem to search "Fendt" & "fendt". The search word is allways made to lower case in the code

.......................................
#1. To add keywords to every item to be easly finded
#2. Add solar panel to caravans
#3. Add documents to caravans and cars
.........................................................................................................

#To see why in the function empty db enters - getItems(itemType, itemsList) 

itemsList is empty db - Because the Search does not find any result, search "f" but it does not find anything




#To see why global search does not work alwaays shows all products - works now

----------------------------------

#1. Array wit text - 5D2025 
#search not wrking - works but with only small letters not capital - now it works the match is toLowercase()

#To chekc the new code if it is ncecery - not necesery



#2. Text on paste ctrl.V or paste not searching - works - Toyota Verso - 20025 г. on paste finds it




#3. Reset global search textxbox on view change



#5. Global search not working. Shows all products allways

#6. On global search change view to home


#7. Need to add /search=my search words - in the adress bar and than the routes should detect it and search and get the result.


#8. It seams that object search in obejct it returns the parrent obejct.

#Ex. Seaarch for fendt in the db it returns caravans, because "fendt" was found in caravans, and does not return the object theat contains the fend but the parrent object with all caravans. Th e other strange thing is that the caravans are not shown in the result, but everything from the db



#9. To check   let type = typeof obj[p]; how it looks when it is array than edit the code to search in an array when array is property of object this was missing. - does not distinguish array, I think
